# Textons-for-texture-synthesis

Texture synthesis is the operation that, from an example of a texture image, consists of synthesizing images that provide the same visual sensation, without being mere copies of the initial image. As we will see in detail in progress, a very simple approach to the problem is to generate Gaussian fields whose statistics are identical to the example, as presented in [1]. A simple way to synthesize such fields is to convolute the sample image with white Gaussian noise.

In [2], it has been proposed to replace the example image with a small thumbnail (a texton), which is particularly important for storage purposes. In [3], an altenrative choice is proposed for the texton, which makes it possible to replace the Gaussian white noise by a simple Poisson process, which makes it possible to accelerate the synthesis.

### The purpose of the project will be
Â - To understand the papers below
 - To implement the proposal of [2]
 - Compare the three approaches [1], [2], [3], using a code provided for [3]
